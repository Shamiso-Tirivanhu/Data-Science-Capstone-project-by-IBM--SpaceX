# Data-Science-Capstone-project-by-IBM--SpaceX
# Introduction

Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. This aim of the project is to create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land successfully.

The capstone project provides a fortaste of what data scientists do in their day-to-day work. The project allows you to assume the role of a data scientist by doing the following:
- Data wrangling.
- Dta Analysis.
- Data Visualization
- Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Model development.
- Model evaluation.
- Communicating ypur findings to peer-data-scientists.

# Objectives

- Explore SpaceX data in order to gain insights in the data.
- Apply machine learning tools to build a predictive model to ascertain whether the SpaceX rocket will land successfully.

# Conclusion
- Successfully build a accurate predictive model for SpaceX
- Business reports submitted to stakeholders.
